- Q: Is there a way to distribute this jar file with preferences pre-set?
  A: Yes. The application will consume a file called "juniuploader.xml" if it finds
  	 this file. The file follows the same format as the one exported -- this is not
  	 the place for sloppy XML. Verify your XML is legal against the DTD. Also, it is
  	 CRITICAL to note that the file is DELETED once it is consumed. Upon any error,
  	 the file will remain intact and the program will retry next time it runs.
