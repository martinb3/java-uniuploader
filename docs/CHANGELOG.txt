Release Version: Beta 10
- Addon folders are now created when they don't exist, allowing you to
  sync addons that you didn't have at all before.

Release Version: Beta 9
- Bugfix for removing form pair groups.
- JavaDoc documentation comments are all fixed, and generate no warnings,
  however much of the code still needs to be JavaDoc'd.

Release Version: Beta 8
- Possible support for Java Web Start in the next version
- Refactoring from Beta 6 and 7 broke some things with preferences, but
  they all should be back to normal now.
- The build script now has some new features, they aren't active yet.
- Sorry for nothing new yet... been busy :)

Release Version: Beta 7
- jUniUploader now comes with source, an ant build file, and javadocs (please
  don't hate my ugly Java skills, I wasn't expecting to release the source without
  cleaning it up more, but then I got busy).
- Monitoring for LUA file changes is almost there. Give me one more beta.
- Fixed a bug with form variable upload lists not being updated.
- Sending roster_update_password with encryption is no longer available. Now you 
  are asked to send a variable encrypted when you add it.
- Mac users should notice the menu bar at the top of the screen shows the name of
  this program instead of ClassRunner (I must work on better names).
- Launch WoW works for Windows users and hopefully Mac users too. Erase all settings
  button is now also enabled, but will require you to exit the program.


Release Version: Beta 6
- Not a lot of changes here, but under the hood, you can now use the jar file
  with the included javadoc documents to call directly into jUniUploader classes
  and write your own Java driver class (think headless!). This is one step closer
  to releasing the source (next release maybe!).
- This beta may be a little buggy, as a lot of the API was changed around
  and some extra useless OO structure was removed (it's still very OO, just not
  over the top!).
- That's all for now. Source soon as my new job is limiting my ability to work
  on this project without other contributions :). Sadly, my new job is having a
  limiting affect on my ability to play WoW as well.

Release Version: Beta 5
- More messages are being displayed in the status bar than before
- Look and Feel of Java Swing is now a saved preference!
- About Panel now exists. When you sync to interface, it will contain your logos!
- I added an export settings button to the app settings panel. Use it wisely.
- Implemented sending of roster_update_password securely functionality and setting
- Changed the Mac "WoW Dir. Guess" to /Applications/World of Warcraft
- For Mac users, we now use a more native-feeling file chooser dialog

Release Version: Beta 4
- Reworking of saving some of our preferences. Hopefully you will be able to open
  two copies of the program, have the last one closed be the most recent saved
  settings. Previously, if you opened the application twice, the first app lost
  valid handles on the preferences data. Also, upload rules are nameless, and I
  previously generated them a random key name. This no longer occurs -- but, it
  means you *could* overwrite a rule in preferences if two rules were *identical*,
  and next time you run you'll only see a single one.
- Added an about panel. This will download 'logo' images from the interface url
  and save them to the current directory. This is part of a greater effort
  to enable UniAdmin and jUniUploader to sync successfully, even though they have
  a different feature set.
- Hopefully there are no more check boxes or data values that aren't saved and
  when you close the program and then reopen it. I've implemented every one by now.
- You can now use the group "none" to submit no form variables. If this doesn't work
  properly, please notify me.
- There's now support for enabling higher levels of debugging, and changing the Look
  and Feel used by Java. Further, the UserAgent box has been moved into the panel too.

Release Version: Beta 3
- Status log at the bottom of the window, reports lots of new info!
- You can export and import current settings to an xml file. See below.
- If an XML file is found in the same directory as the class/jar, named
  juniuploader.xml, its settings will get imported before the program reads
  from system preferences. Once consumed, this XML file WILL be deleted.
- An application settings panel has been added. Yes, I still need to move some
  of the settings from the UA panel there. You'll find logging settings are not
  saved when you close the program. I feel like this is necessary since it
  produces so much information.

Release Version: Beta 2
- Windows don't bounce outwards as lists are populated with data
- All settings except for checkboxes are saved and restored now
- Buttons for uploading and syncing are disabled while those actions complete
- Logging is much more specific, but there's no GUI way to adjust it yet
