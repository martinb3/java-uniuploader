1. How to synchronize with your interface.php file: Add this URL to the text box 
in the interface panel. Check the appropriate boxes. Then click the Sync button 
on the main menu.

2. How to upload files to your roster site: Enter the correct site (URL of update.php),
then you need to make a "group" of form variables if you need to submit a username or 
password to update.php (the roster). You probably need a variable called "username" and 
one called "password" with the appropriate values. If you want to update the roster
itself, you will also need one called "roster_update_password."

This version supports uploading from multiple WoW directories, multiple accounts, 
multiple files, and multiple Roster's. But -- You MUST create an "upload rule" for 
each file. I could have allowed multiple LUA (SVs) files per upload rule, but I 
decided it was silly since you hardly ever upload more than 2 files (= 2 rules), and 
uploading is much more responsive / fails less if you are uploading one file per 
HTTP post.
