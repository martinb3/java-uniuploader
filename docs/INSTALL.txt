An open-source Java version of everyone's favorite uploader tool. It has been 
verified to work fairly well on both Windows and Mac. This client requires the Java 
runtime version 1.4 or higher.

This project is Open Source, under an Apache license, and includes some components 
from the Jakarta Commons project. With a 1.4 or greater JDK and Apache Ant, you 
may build this project from source. It also includes classes that allow you to add jUU 
functionality to new Java projects or write your own headless client with a few simple 
method calls.

It is seeking someone to adopt it and continue to improve it, as the original developer 
doesn't play WoW anymore and doesn't have time to maintain it.  I used 1.4 
(i.e. j2jdk1.4.2) for building everything, as well as Ant and Eclipse. Right 
now, the source is very ugly, but it has been released.

Inside the ZIP, there are a bunch of text files, as well as a single jar file. If you've
properly installed Java on your operating system (1.4 or higher!), you should
be able to double click on the jar and it will run the program.

Right now, there is no installer other than just running the jar file. If you
have somehome ruined your Java installation, but are able to run "java" on a
terminal or command line, you may try "java -jar thejarfilename.jar" to run the
program that way.
